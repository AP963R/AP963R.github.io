# AP963R.github.io

A recent project for a reselling shoe company. Enjoyed making the site easy to use on a one-page layout. The owner needed something that would add professionalism to his brand and help him deal with customer enquires (contact form) as he didn't enjoy dealing with everything through Instagram Messages.

Some of the challenges yet to be encountered will be in building the store side of the site where they will be able to keep stock up to date with images and a fully functioning checkout system. The owner isn't too concerned with this side of the site at present because he is still growing the business.
